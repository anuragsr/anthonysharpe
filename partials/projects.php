        <p>NISSAN innovation lab needed a film to demonstrate the marketing potential of the new technologies they are developing. 
        This film aimed to set the body color-shifting potential in a premium universe and gather feedback on social-media.</p>
        <p>We delivered two versions of the film, a short pre-roll and an extended version. Our take on the project was to build a 
        premium identity through casting and locations.</p>

        <p>INFINITI needed a cross carline commercial that would 
        allow the three car models to display both singular and brand identity. 
        We helped the brand with both the Video and Photo production of 
        the campaign.</p>
        <p>Our input on the project was to build a premium feel to the story, 
        linking multiple stories together. The focus needed to be on elegance 
        and performance. The shooting took place in the French Alps with world 
        level top triathletes.</p>

        clarify its identity, by bringing together its activities in a business card film.</p>

        visibility around a double promise. The sporting promise, associated with 
        a promise of relaxation, exploration and surpassing oneself. By moving away 
        from a conventional and expected sporting treatment, we are convincing a 
        European public to convert the event into an opportunity to stay in a legendary city.</p>
        <p>We delivered a teaser ahead of the event, and filming during the first edition 
        resulted in the social media campaign film, a film for sponsors as well as a 26′
